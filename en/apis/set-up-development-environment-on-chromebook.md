## Set up Linux on your Chromebook

Linux is a feature that lets you develop software using your Chromebook. Install Linux command line tools, code editors, and IDEs (integrated development environments) on your Chromebook. These can be used to write code, create apps, and more.&#x20;

**Important:** If you use your Chromebook at work or school, you might be unable to use Linux. For more information, [contact your administrator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6208960).

Linux is off by default. You can turn it on at any time from Settings.
