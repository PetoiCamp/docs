# ðŸ”‹ Battery

## The robot battery&#x20;

Though you can program BiBoard directly or NyBoard with the USB uploader, external power is required to drive the servos separately.&#x20;

When the mainboard is powered by USB, the blue LED lights up. When external batteries power the mainboard, the yellow LED lights up.

### Parameters

Rechargeable Li-ion Battery

Model: ZCF503060

Rated Capacity: 1000mAh/7.4Wh

Input: 5V-1.5A

The servos require 7.4\~8.4V external power to move. Our customized Li-ion battery has a built-in charging and protection circuit. **Clicking** the battery's button will show its status. <mark style="color:blue;">**Blue**</mark> light indicates it has power, and <mark style="color:red;">**red**</mark> means the power is low. **Long-pressing** the button for 3 seconds to power on/off the battery.  &#x20;

### Connection and Power On

Be careful with the polarity when connecting the power supply. The terminal on the main board has an anti-reverse socket, so you won't be able to plug in the wrong direction.  See [here](https://bittle.petoi.com/4-Assemble-The-Frame#4.2.7-battery) for the detailed connection instructions. Before powering, insert the battery's plug into the main board's terminal.&#x20;
