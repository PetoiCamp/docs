# BiBoard Preparation

Plug in the battery and long-press the battery button to power on the robot.

For BiBoard, please ensure the program enters the [**regular startup mode**](https://docs.petoi.com/arduino-ide/upload-sketch-for-biboard#id-2.8-program-initialization)**.**

The USB data cable connection must be made directly to **the BiBoard** and NOT to the battery's outside charging port. &#x20;

You can also connect to the computer via [Bluetooth](https://docs.petoi.com/bluetooth-connection).
