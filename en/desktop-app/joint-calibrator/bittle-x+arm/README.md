# Bittle X+Arm

{% hint style="info" %}
Bittle X+Arm is Bittle X equipped with a robotic arm.
{% endhint %}

The subpages mention the joint calibration interface for Bittle X+Arm, which uses BiBoard V0 and BiBoard V1 in the Petoi Desktop App.

## Prepare for calibration

This robotic arm is already fully assembled.

* For the **construction** kit\
  Install the short wire servo in the servo slot on the robotic arm with two M2\*5 self-tapping screws. \

*   For the **pre-assembled** kit

    &#x20;You only need to install the servo with the neck structure in the servo slot with two M2\*5 self-tapping screws.\

## Installation for the construction kit in the calibration state

For the construction kit, after entering the calibration state, please install the legs and robotic arm as follows:

### Install the legs

The process is the same as [Bittle / Bittle X's](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M-_eWZUjFA4usjshHcZ/s/-MQ6a951Q6Jn1Zzt5Ajr-887967055/~/changes/650/desktop-app/joint-calibrator/bittle-bittle-x/~/overview#install-the-legs).

### Install the robotic arm

Place the robotic arm as close to the central axis as possible and insert its servo shaft into the servo arm of the neck.

## Fine-tuning

The process of fine-tuning the legs and the Servo 0  is the same as that of Bittle / Bittle Xegs process is the same as [Bittle / Bittle X's](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M-_eWZUjFA4usjshHcZ/s/-MQ6a951Q6Jn1Zzt5Ajr-887967055/~/changes/650/desktop-app/joint-calibrator/bittle-bittle-x#fine-tuning).

Please click the blank part of the slider track and follow the calibration posture below to fine-tune Servo 1 on the robotic arm.

Please click the Auto button to fine-tune the claw (Servo 2) on the robotic arm.

You can also manually click the blank part of the corresponding slider track and adjust the gear on the servo output shaft to the position shown in the figure above.
