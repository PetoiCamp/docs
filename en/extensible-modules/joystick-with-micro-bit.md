## Hardware

{% hint style="info" %}
Micro: Bit V1 has a smaller memory. So, the full functionality requires **Micro: Bit V2**.
{% endhint %}

## Software setup

The Joystick's source code is now open-sourced. It can control Bittle X, Bittle X+Arm (Bittle with a robotic arm), and Nybble Q. For more information, please refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/ESP32_Microbit_Controller).

You can download the program file([microbit-JoyStick.hex](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/ESP32_Microbit_Controller/blob/main/microbit-JoyStick.hex)), then import the program to [the programming platform makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org) as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend you use the **Chrome** browser.

After a successful connection, a disk drive named `MICROBIT` is recognized on the computer.

## How to use&#x20;

1. [Upload the newest firmware](https://docs.petoi.com/upload-firmware) to the robot (mainboard type: **BiBoard**)
2. Install 2 x #7 AAA batteries and plug in the Micro: Bit V2 to the remote controller. Then power on the remote controller as follows:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)\

3. Power on the robot. During the bootup, it can connect to the controller automatically via Bluetooth.\
   If there are many remote controllers and robots, the connection is one-to-one and first-come-first-served.

{% hint style="info" %}
After a successful Bluetooth connection, the robot automatically disconnects every 20 minutes (indicated by an hourglass animation on the LED matrix). To re-establish the Bluetooth connection, touch the Micro: Bit's logo (a touch button) and hold the controller vertically with the left joystick at the lower side, as shown in the figure:\

After a successful reconnection, you will hear a prompt tone, and the LED matrix will play an animated hourglass flowing reversely.
