{% hint style="info" %}
The interfaces above will be displayed when you calibrate for the first time. You can also click to open the upper-right menu in the control panel and select **Calibrate** to re-access.\

{% endhint %}

**For the** pre-assembled kit, you can directly power on the robot and use the mobile app to fine-tune all joints.

**For the construction kit, after** the robot enters the calibration state, do the following steps:

### Install the neck servo and leg servos

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

You must use the neck section with a J-hook (as pictured below) to avoid the neck from falling when using this robot arm.

{% endhint %}

Installing the neck servo is the same as [installing the head](bittle.md#install-the-head) of Bittle.

Installing the leg servos is the same as [installing the legs](bittle.md#install-the-legs) of Bittle.

### Install the robot arm

This robot arm is already fully assembled. After finishing calibrating the neck servo and the leg servos, power off the robot and [install](../../extensible-modules/robot-arm/#installation) the servo slot on the neck servo with two M2\*5 self-tapping screws.

Then, power on the robot, and do the joint calibration for the servos on the robot arm.
