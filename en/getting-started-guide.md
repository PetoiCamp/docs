# Getting Started Guide

Hi, thanks for getting a Petoi robot.

If you have a construction kit, you can follow the following instructions to build it.

* [Bittle](https://bittle.petoi.com/1-tools-and-preparation)
* [Bittle X](https://bittle-x.petoi.com/1-preparation)
  * If you have a Bittle X V2 kit(as indicated on the package barcode label), please pay attention to [the BiBoard V1 servo wiring guide](https://bittle.petoi.com/4-connect-the-wires#biboard-v1-for-bittle-x-v2) and select BiBoard V1 during the firmware upload process with [Petoi Firmware Uploader](desktop-app/firmware-uploader.md).
* [Nybble](https://nybble.petoi.com/chapter1)

### After you’ve assembled a Petoi robot or have bought a pre-assembled version, the following steps are recommended:

1. [Play with mobile app](https://docs.petoi.com/mobile-app/controller)
   * Play with the default actions
   * Play with [simple joint control](https://docs.petoi.com/mobile-app/controller#move-bittles-head-move-joint-angle)
   * Add [more commands](https://docs.petoi.com/mobile-app/controller#available-commands-to-be-added) to the controller panel
   * Play with [group commands](https://docs.petoi.com/mobile-app/controller#create-a-group-command) to make your robot perform multiple actions in sequence
2. [Play with voice commands](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/voice-command-module#play-with-the-voice-commands)(for Bittle X or any robot with the voice command module)
   * If the robot doesn’t respond to your voice commands,  please see [the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/voice-command-module#how-to-debug-if-the-voice-command-doesnt-work).
   * You can [turn off the voice command functionality](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/voice-command-module#id-2.-turn-on-off-the-voice-command-functionality-audio-response-and-robotics-reaction)(for example: in a public space, or in a classroom setting requiring quiet periods) to avoid accidentally triggering voice responses and robot reactions.
3. Do some coding
   * Follow [Petoi Coding Blocks curriculum](https://www.petoi.com/pages/free-quadruped-robotics-curriculum-scratch-coding) to [program some Petoi robotics moves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHMFXft_rV6POrzm8O12Nybdy1-FS1ymg)
   * [Visually design](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHMFXft_rV6MTs8HMxSOvRAQektoXtaMG) some new robotics skills with [Petoi Skill Composer](https://docs.petoi.com/desktop-app/skill-composer)&#x20;
   * Follow [C++ curriculum](https://www.petoi.com/pages/free-cplusplus-quadruped-robotics-curriculum) to code some Petoi robotics moves in C++
   * For Bittle/Bittle X, you may [3D-print this stand](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/NonCodeFiles/tree/master/stl/BittleStand) to make your robot not run around while you program it.
4. Work on some [quadruped robotics competition projects](https://www.petoi.com/blogs/blog/robot-competitions-with-petoi)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that all the tutorials work on Bittle/Bittle X robot dogs and Nybble robot cat even though we use one particular robot pet as an example.

### FAQ

**Question:** I am confused by the product packaging and unsure if you sent me the right robot.

**Answer:** We reuse the packaging for Bittle and BIttle X.  If you order a Bittle but receive a package with “**Bittle X**” marking, or vice versa,  you can check the text label with the barcode.  That text identifies what’s inside the packaging.

Check [other FAQs](https://www.petoi.com/pages/faq) on our official website or [those](https://docs.petoi.com/technical-support/faq-frequently-asked-questions) in the Petoi Doc Center.\
